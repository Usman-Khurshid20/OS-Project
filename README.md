# OS Project

## Project Description
This project is focused on creating a basic operating system simulation. The main goal is to implement core operating system features such as memory management, process scheduling, file systems, and other fundamental functionalities in an OS environment.

The project will help in understanding how operating systems work at a low level and give insight into the complexities of resource management in computing.
